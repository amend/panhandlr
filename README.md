I hacked together a small site called Panhandlr. It shows the top 25 best panhandling spots in Austin. 

Data collected from the city of Austin site. The data shows intersections of Austin and how much traffic they get. The top 25 intersections each had between 50000 and 30000 cars drive by on the day it was collected. Most intersections had 2000 to 200.

It's supposed to be half parody half useful. So if you have any homeless buds or are part of an organization that panhandles to raise funds and would like to collect more, check it out!
